## Papers

First install the dependencies (installation procedure varies by
operating system and/or distribution):

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) including
  [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) which is used to install Jekyll
* Dependencies for Jekyll:
    * [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
    * [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    * Ruby development headers (typically installed automatically with
      Ruby, except on Linux)

Then use Bundler to install Jekyll:

    $ bundle install
 the `jekyll serve` command.
